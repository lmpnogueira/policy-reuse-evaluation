# Overview

Policy-as-Code (PaC) has become an important approach for automating governance, security, and compliance throughout cloud-native software delivery pipelines. However, equivalent governance policies are frequently implemented independently across multiple validation stages, increasing maintenance effort and creating opportunities for policy drift.

This work investigates whether a **shared policy-definition layer** can be reused consistently across complementary enforcement stages while preserving governance enforcement throughout the software delivery lifecycle.

The proposed reusable multi-stage Policy-as-Code enforcement model evaluates identical Rego policy definitions during:

- Continuous Integration (CI) validation using **Conftest**
- Kubernetes admission control using **OPA Gatekeeper**

Rather than introducing a new policy language, policy engine, or enforcement framework, the study empirically evaluates the practical feasibility of policy reuse across complementary enforcement stages.

The experimental evaluation investigates:

- automatic detection of insecure Kubernetes configurations;
- governance assurance through multi-stage enforcement;
- mitigation of CI bypass scenarios through deployment-time admission control.

The same Rego policy definitions are reused throughout the evaluation. Consequently, any observed differences arise from the execution context rather than from differences in policy implementation.

# Experimental Dataset

| Item | Value |
|------|------:|
| Kubernetes manifests | 29 |
| Experimental scenarios | 37 |
| Kubernetes resource types | 8 |
| Governance policies | 5 |
| Rego `deny` rules | 9 |
| Policy assertions | 261 |

The dataset includes:

- compliant workloads;
- negative-control resources;
- single-policy violations;
- multi-policy violations;
- CI bypass scenarios.

Every experimental scenario specifies its expected outcome *a priori*, enabling objective and reproducible evaluation of policy behaviour.

# Governance Policies

| Policy | Description | CI | Admission Control |
|---------|-------------|:--:|:----------------:|
| P1 | No Root Execution | ✓ | ✓ |
| P2 | No Privilege Escalation | ✓ | ✓ |
| P3 | Resource Requests and Limits Required | ✓ | – |
| P4 | No Mutable Image Tags (`latest`) | ✓ | ✓ |
| P5 | No Privileged Containers | ✓ | – |

The policies implemented exclusively during Continuous Integration reflect the implementation scope adopted for the evaluated proof-of-concept rather than limitations of OPA Gatekeeper or of the proposed architectural model.

# Reproducing the Evaluation

## 1. Continuous Integration Validation

```bash
conftest test tests/
```

---

## 2. Deploy OPA Gatekeeper

```bash
kubectl apply -f gatekeeper/
```

---

## 3. Execute Admission-Control Validation

Submit the Kubernetes manifests contained in `tests/` to the cluster.

Admission decisions are evaluated through Kubernetes validating admission webhooks using the same governance requirements implemented in the shared Rego policy-definition layer.

---

## 4. Compare Results

Compare the observed policy decisions with the expected outcomes provided in the experimental scenarios.

The evaluation metrics reported in the paper (Detection Rate, False Positive Rate, False Negative Rate, Policy Coverage, and CI Bypass Protection) can then be reproduced.

# Research Questions

The experimental evaluation addresses the following research questions.

### RQ1

Can reusable Policy-as-Code definitions accurately detect insecure Kubernetes configurations automatically?

### RQ2

Can reusable Policy-as-Code definitions be enforced consistently across Continuous Integration validation and Kubernetes admission control?

### RQ3

Can Kubernetes admission control mitigate governance failures caused by CI bypass scenarios?
